# LabView-Ardurino
Program that controls a little car and maps the distance traveled

It is my very first project in Ardurino and in LabView. I used following componets:
-servo (which can rorate over 360 degrees) x2
-distance sensor HC-SR04 2-200cm
-Arduino Uno
-small contact plate
-some Lego bloks,double-sided tape, etc.to make vehicle
